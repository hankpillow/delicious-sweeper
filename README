About:
======
This is a service which helps you to find out the urls you've bookmarked into Delicious that got offline.

I started coding this project in ruby and running via command line just for fun, and I realize that would be nice doing a browser version of it.

I'm not a python programmer, just learned some tricks to make it work and have so much fun playing with [jquery](http://jquery.com/) and [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

How to run?
======

You can run this project [here](http://delicious-sweeper.appspot.com/) or run it in your own machine:

1. clone this [project](https://github.com/hankpillow/delicious-sweeper "Github").
2. download [google app engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python "Google App Engine") for python.
3. open the GAE app and map the cloned folder
4. run your app!

Disclaimer
======

First of all this is a **personal** project.

Absolutely no personal information is kept, shared or so. The Delicious API seems to not be the most trustful thing at all, service timeout happens all the time. Be patient and use carefully!

This is a private project for personal use only!
